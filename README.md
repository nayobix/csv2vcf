# csv2vcf

eGroupware 1.8 export its Adressbook into CSV format, which IS NOT compatible with
eGroupware 14.0+ vCard v.3 Addressbook.

So this tool aim to convert the exported CSV file into most important vCard v.3 fields in eGroupware 14.0+

If there is some field which is missing in generated vCard, then you can just map it in the script.
